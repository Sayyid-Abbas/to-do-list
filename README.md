## [To Do List](https://sayyid-abbas.github.io/to-do-list/)

The main focus in this project was the use of local storage, that effects the project in two ways:
1. When reloading the page, the content will stay as it was.
2. When deleting or clearing the tasks, they will be erased from local storage.
- Note: CSS styling wasn't the focus, so itâ€™s kept simple.
